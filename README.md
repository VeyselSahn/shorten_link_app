#Grisoft Challenge
  
  Firstly ,I am still working for another company, so I didnt have so much time and I didnt complete code somewhere.
  1. Valid Link , You have to login like 'flutter.com' 
  2. I used provider , But i  used so little state management(for copying text and empty field).
  3. I didnt write test for whole apps (just for api).
  4. I have a windows computer so I couldnt test on ios.

As a techs
  - for caching , used Hive
  - network side , dio

Shorten Api Service gave certificate error , when i used my phone internet.
Ä°f you will face the same problem , I can try to solve if you tell me
