#Grisoft Challenge

  Firstly ,I am still working for another company, so I didnt have so much time and I didnt complete code somewhere.
  1. Valid Link , added but just showing , not working correctly. 
  2. I used provider , But i didnt use so much state managment so Thats not matter.
  3. I didnt write test for whole apps (just for api).
  4. I have a windows computer so I couldnt test on ios.

As a techs
